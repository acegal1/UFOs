# UFOs

# Overview of Project

Create an interactive website that provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. For specification of this project, we have added the table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Resources

Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB

Software: ES6+, ECMAScript, Visual Studio Code

# Results

- The UFOs Project has an enhanced webpage with capability to add filters with multiple factors. D3 functionality creates an instance listener for multiple changes in our search, displaying needed datasets on the result table.

# Summury

### Drawback

- The color/font inside the filter boxes gives you the impression that the data is being filtered already.
- Option to clear the text from search.  


### Recommendations

- We could add another filter with duration to show for example events longer than 10 minutes, or also we can add the description by filtering by key words, like "bright".

- We could add another style for the table and add the placeholder as an example to know the correct way to input the data.

- We can include live testimonies that were transcribed and published in the data.
